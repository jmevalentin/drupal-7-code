=== MODULE NAME ===
 jme_groups

=== PURPOSE ===
 Provide custom Organic Groups functionality

=== Q&A ===
What challenges were you trying to solve?
- Managing users and groups with the base OG module is cumbersome. This module provides enhancements that make this easier, including a custom form to select users and add/remove them to/from groups

What did you enjoy about the project?
- Organic groups is a great way to divde and manage user access, but it's a bit cumbersome. I was able to come up with interfaces to improve the user experience.

What would you do differently if you could do it over?
- I would spend more time searching for available solutions and testing those  I found. Timelines prevented this.
- I would document more thoroughly
- I would not name functions after my initials
